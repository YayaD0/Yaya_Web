		<h2><strong>Expression of Yaya in vector art</strong></h2>
		<p> &#10004;The program used for the vector avatar is Adobe Illustrator.
	In the avatar you can see there is alot going on with the face and i did this intentionally because i feel like it represents me. Towards the bottom of the face i put the colors of Senegal it is were my family is from so i always have a place for it in my heart. For the rest of the face you would see various colors and shapes everywhere forming the face, I chose this approach to makeup the avatar face because just like the face in real life i am always everywhere trying and learning new things and at times it feels like there is alot going on which was my inspiration for creating a face with a bunch of shapes going on.</p>

	<h2><strong> Raster Portrait of Favorite Things & Experiences </strong></h2>
		<p> &#10004;The program used in this raster image is Adobe Photoshop. The 4 images chosen along my self portrait is 1. Senegal, 2. New York, 3. doberman dog, and 4. a nft. I chose these images because they each have an impact on me in my personal life. Senegal is were my parents and family are mostly from, New York is were i was born and raised, I grew up with a doberman during my childhood which protected me many times, and lastly nfts because although i am not heavily invested into it i learned alot during my journey and research into the web3 space which expanded my knowledge on the landscape. My inspiration came from stuff that is apart of me that i hold dearly to my heart and also experiences/lessons with the web3 space and nfts.</p>
